# Obstacles

From @Cynichill

shooting a bubbled enemy with another bubble pushes the bubble away

Defend against fish barrage - tidepool 3

If water makes you immune to magma men, you could do something like having pools of water as safety zones the player has to reach between magma men hell. Could use rock dogs

Throw bodies at spark traps to trigger far away stuff & weird angles

vertical level about guiding the bubble to the top without popping
